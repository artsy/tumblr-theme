ART.SY Tumblr Theme Readme
==========================

The theme lives in one file and it is intended that you simply copy and paste the `theme.html` contents
into the custom template form on the tumblr site. The latest editor has syntax highlighting and you get 
instant feedback on your changes. 

## To-Dos:
* Work out the fonts. What can we legally use on a Tumblr blog?
* Finish the remaining post types (only photo and text posts are in the theme).
